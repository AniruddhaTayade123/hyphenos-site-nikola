    <h2>Prototype and R&D</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes, a new product or service offering that a company wants to develop is not completely aligned with
        the
        existing engineering skills. We help companies in developing a quick prototype to assess the feasibility,
        both
        technical and business. Depending upon customer's need and expertise, we help in developing the first
        version of
        the product from an early PoC or a prototype.
